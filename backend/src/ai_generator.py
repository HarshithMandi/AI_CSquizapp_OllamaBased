    prompt = f"""You are an expert coding challenge creator. Generate a {difficulty} level coding question with multiple choice answers.

For easy questions: Focus on basic syntax, simple operations, or common programming concepts.
For medium questions: Cover intermediate concepts like data structures, algorithms, or language features.  
For hard questions: Include advanced topics, design patterns, optimization techniques, or complex algorithms.

IMPORTANT: If your question references a code snippet, include the complete code snippet in the title itself. Do not reference external code.

Examples of good titles:
- "What does this Python code print: x = [1, 2, 3]; print(len(x))"
- "Which method correctly adds an element to a Python list?"
- "What is the time complexity of binary search?"

You must respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

    "correct_answer_id": 0,

}}

Make sure the options are plausible but with only one clearly correct answer."""
